            Welcome to Taktics.net! A website created as a gift to community of the strategy game Tak. This site is dedicated to helping Tak players improve their game.

            We are currently preparing for a launch of the <span style="color: #c4c4c4;">closed alpha. </span> To do this, we are
            extracting puzzles from a database of almost <span style="color: #C4C4C4;">70,000 Tak games </span> using AI. This is a complex process, but it is
            an interesting problem and a fun challenge so we are happy to tackle it. We hope to launch January 2, 2017.
